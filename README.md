# Stuff About Me ;)

## Intro
My name is Layla. I am in 11th grade, and I am on Varsity Girls Basketball team for Chatsworth.

### Summer Activities
- I went to summer camp with my church for 5 days and it was really fun. My cabin leader, 4 other girls in my cabin, and I went hiking at 4 in the morning and saw elk. I didn't participate in the games but they were fun to watch. I played cards with some friends almost everyday. The food there was absolutely discusting tho. Like eggs that were made from powder idk. It was just really gross. Our team color was yellow (my least fav color) and we painted one of the girls in our cabin yellow and made her wear jean shorts and goggles to look like a minion. The team with the most "spirit" gets the spirit stick and a load of points for the team so thats why we did it. We only got the spirit stick in the last day tho lol. But yeah it was fun.
- We had team beach day with my basketball team. Its something we do every year at the end of summer. Its a really good way for us to bond as a team. We all bring food, snack, and drinks. We just chill, go in the water, have fun. I like to go far and I tend to drag along the most of my tea with me to jump over the waves. Its all just fun and games.
